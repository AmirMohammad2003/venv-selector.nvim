## ‚òÑ Getting started

Once the plugin has been installed, the `:VenvActivate` command is available.

This plugin will look for python virtual environments located close to your code.

It will start looking in the same directory as your currently opened file. Usually the venv is located in a parent
directory. By default it will go up 2 levels in the directory tree (relative to your currently open file), and then go back down into all the directories under that
directory. Finally it will give you a list of found virtual environments so you can pick one to activate.

## Dependencies

This plugin has been built to be as fast as possible. It will search your computer for virtual environments while you
continue working, and it wont freeze the neovim gui while looking for them. Usually it will give you a result in a few seconds.

Note: You need [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) installed on your system. This plugin uses it to search for
the virtual environments as fast as possible.

Telescope is also needed to let you pick a virtual environment to use.

## ‚öô Configuration

```lua
require("venv-selector").setup({
    -- How many steps to go up in the directory tree when looking for virtual environments.
    parents = 2,
    -- The name of the venv to look for
    name = "venv",
})
```
